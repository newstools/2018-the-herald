SYDNEY. — Opener Jason Roy recorded the highest-ever one-day international cricket score by an England player as the tourists finally had something to celebrate with a five-wicket win over Australia at the MCG yesterday. After their wretched Ashes campaign, in which they were beaten 4-0, the tourists chased down a hefty Australian total in Melbourne to win with seven balls to spare in the opener of the five-match ODI series. Set 305 to win, Roy’s daring 180 helped England make 308 for five. The successful chase was also a record for a one-day international at the MCG, eclipsing Australia’s 297 for four against England in 2011, and vindicated captain Eoin Morgan’s decision to bowl first. Having been an onlooker for the test series, Roy was an unlikely hero. But he rode his luck to produce a record in limited-overs cricket for England and also a new benchmark for a batsman at the MCG in a one-day international. The swashbuckling right-hander lived dangerously throughout his innings, charging along at better than a run a ball and reaching his half-century off only 32 balls. He survived a run-out scare and an lbw decision which was overturned upon review, and lofted several balls just out of the reach of frustrated Australian fielders on the way to his fifth ODI century. — AFP
