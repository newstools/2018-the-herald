LONDON. — Manchester United are close to reaching an agreement with manager Jose Mourinho over a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 2021, British media said on Tuesday. The reports said there had been good progress in talks and the Portuguese was likely to stay at Old Trafford for longer than the three-year deal he signed through to June 2019. Mourinho (54) has described his commitment to United as “total” and said he wanted to “bring the club to where the club belongs”. He has described reports he could leave as “garbage”. Mourinho won the League Cup and Europa League in his first season in charge, though United finished sixth in the league. They currently sit second, 12 points behind local rivals Manchester City, and are in the Champions League last 16 and FA Cup fourth round. Mourinho is currently midway through the three-year deal he signed when he succeeded Louis van Gaal in May 2016. That contract expires in June 2019. It is believed talks between Mourinho’s agent Jorge Mendes and United’s hierarchy over a new contract began in October. Throughout that time Mourinho has made it clear he wants to stay at Old Trafford and he recently said his commitment to the club is “total”. He added that his intention was to “bring the club to where the club belongs” and described reports he could leave this summer as “garbage”. Significantly, Mourinho has been pleased with the commitment the club has shown to him by going after his transfer targets and getting them.At the moment, United are looking to break with their recent transfer window tradition and bring in a major signing in January in the shape of Alexis Sanchez. Sky Sports News understands the club are leading the chase to sign the Chile international after Manchester City withdrew from negotiations over costs. It is also understood that Sanchez’s move to Old Trafford hinges on Henrikh Mkhitaryan agreeing terms with Arsenal and moving in the opposite direction. — Reuters.
