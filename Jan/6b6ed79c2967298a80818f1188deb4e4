Sports Reporter MR Pace Athletics club owner Collen Makaza has urged middle and long-distance runners to take advantage of tomorrow’s cross country meet the club is hosting in Chitungwiza as they gear up for the season. The competition will take place at Seke 6 High School with participants from clubs and schools set to compete in the seniors, juniors and youths. The senior men and women will take part in the 10km race while the junior (Under-20) men and women will compete in the 8km and 6km races respectively. For the youth (Under-18), the boys will fight for honours in the 6km event while the girls take part in the 4km run. The cadets (Under-13) will not be left out as there is a 2km race on offer for them. Makaza said all is in place for the meet which is mainly a preparatory event for upcoming major competitions. “This is a season opener we organised for middle and long distance runners. Last week we had the national season opener for track and field, so this is for middle and long-distance runners but it’s a club event. “So this is like the warm up to prepare for their upcoming big events. Most of the athletes are promising to come, we have invited schools, both primary and secondary and private colleges around Chitungwiza. “So I think we are going to get a better crowd and also the fact that we are taking the sport to the people, I am hopeful it’s going to be a success,” said Makaza. Some of the athletes expected to take part include last year’s Old Mutual winners Canisious Nyamutsita and Bertha Chikanga from Mr Pace Athletics club. Nyamutsita said he is looking forward to the event as he prepares for the Two Oceans coming up in March. “I am not yet there in terms of preparedness so I am hoping this will help me get the fitness I want. It’s actually part of my preparations for this year after taking a break since last October when I had my last competitive competition.
