MELBOURNE. — Marin Cilic dominated British hope Kyle Edmund in straight sets to become the first Croatian to reach the final of the Australian Open tennis tournament yesterday. The world No. 6 powered into his third Grand Slam decider with a 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 win in 2hr 18min on Rod Laver Arena over the unseeded Edmund to be the first man into Sunday’s final. He will face either defending champion Roger Federer or unseeded South Korean Chung Hyeon, who play today. “Overall I’m feeling really good,” Cilic said. “Now I have two days off before the final. “I noticed in the third game of the third set, when I broke him, he just let a couple of balls go past him. “So I realised his movement was a little bit restricted, so I just tried to move the ball around and obviously that second break was extremely crucial.” — AFP.
