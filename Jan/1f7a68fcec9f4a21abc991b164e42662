Talent Banda Arts Correspondent Events management company Events Evolution has upped their game following the purchase of high quality cameras and big screens that will be used at big events. The new equipment comes months after they purchased state-of-the-art equipment that include a PA system from Germany that was used at Bishop TD Jakes event at National Sports Stadium last year. It can be used to address more than 300 000 people in an open space and can also be split into smaller units for small venues and crowds. nEvents Evolution founder Talent Banda said the coming of the new equipment was a way of beefing up their sound system as well as having enough facilities to host high profile events. “We want to beef up the equipment so that we give our clients value for their money. We went to Germany and we were four of us. Before purchasing we went for some lessons on how to use it. Now our four engineers have the proper knowledge on how to use it,” he said. Their main aim is to change how events are managed in the country.“We have acquired also large screens and camera. “We are doing all this to change the way events are managed in the country and that is why we are Events Evolution,I had a number of enquiries from South African engineers who were here at TD Jakes event who want to know about this system,” he said.
