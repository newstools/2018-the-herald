CASABLANCA. — Congo-Brazzaville moved to the top of Group D in the 2018 African Nations Championship after beating Cameroon 1-0 at the Stade Adrar on Tuesday night. The result, combined with Group D’s early match on Tueday night which saw Angola and Burkina Faso play to a 0-0 draw, leaves Congo atop the standings with three points. Congo, though, suffered an early set-back in the match when Moise Nkounkou had to leave the field injured in the 12th minute and was replaced by Prestige Mboungou. This disrupted the flow of the Congolese team and Cameroon took the upper hand. However, despite seeing more of the ball possession and controlling the flow of the game the Indomitable Lions were poor in the final third with attackers Frantz Pangop and Bonny Elame wasteful in front of goal. Consequently, due to Cameroon’s poor finishing the first half ended 0-0. Congo were much better in the second half, but they struggled to muster any real threat in front of goal until the won a penalty in the 72nd minute which Junior Makiesse converted to give them the lead. Cameroon tried to fight their way back into the game after that and threw players forward in attack, but they could not breach the resilient Congolese defence. Meanwhile, Angola and Burkina Faso drew 0-0 in the other Group D match at the Stade Adrar on Tuesday. — AFP.
