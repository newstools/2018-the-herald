Fiona Chinembiri Yeukai Karengezeka-Chisepo Arts Correspondent After a four-year sabbatical, gospel musician Fiona Chinembiri has broken the silence with the release of a new album titled “Recovery”. The fresh project that is loaded with praise songs was recorded at Tach Studios and produced by Tapiwa Njonjonjo. The singer is happy with the reception the album has received so far, few weeks after its release. “I am really honoured that my new album has been received well by music fans so far. After years of hard work I am happy that people are enjoying it. I rate this as the best I album I have ever produced and I believe it will open up greater opportunities for me in the music industry,” she said. As the album title implies, the songs are anchored on victory stories that she has experienced in her life. Gospel music lovers are spoilt for choice as the album incorporates different genres. In the song “Victory” she retraces how Jesus Christ defeated death and overcame the world for the sake of His creation thanking and celebrating him for giving Christians victory over any challenges they may encounter in life. “Ndokutendai Jesu”, is a thanksgiving song for his goodness and the musician pledges to continue serving him considering how he has transformed her personal life. The two songs mentioned above were written by Pastor Takura Rukwati. “I didn’t write all the songs on the album some were written by a man whom I regard as my mentor in life, Pastor Rukwati who is a talented song writer. His contributions have helped me to reach where I am today,” she said proudly. Other songs on the album are “Inyasha” and theme song “Recovery”. The musician started her musical career in 2006 with an album titled “Isai Pacalvary”, followed by “Munamato Wangu” of (2008) then “Prophet Zimbabwe” of 2013. Chinembiri has worked and shared stage with other musicians such as Mahendere Brothers, Gospel Power, Psalmist Hubert C and Leonard Zhakata just to mention a few.
