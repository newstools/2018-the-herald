Abel Mavura Tawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent When author Abel Mavura penned his book “The Art of Realising your Dream” he was optimistic that it would make an impact in the society. The response, according to the young author, is overwhelming and he is already motivated to pen another inspirational book. In South Africa, Mavura claims the book has sold more than 400 copies with other countries yet to bring their statics. In Zimbabwe, he said, more than 1 500 books have been sold to date. Those notable achievements by the book in three months are enough to give Mavura inspiration to pen another book. “The response is something else as it has attracted the attention of different people from all walks of life. Among them are musicians, business people and politicians,” he said. He said it is by the grace of God that he already has such achievements from the book. “It is by the grace of God that I managed to have all these achievements. The impact of the book is something else and I am encouraged and as I speak am penning another book,” he said. Mavura believes life is viewed as dynamic system with inputs, processes and outputs. “Inputs are the efforts we put towards our goals. Processes are the challenges we face and outputs is the new being after all the hassles,” he said. The 30-year-old author believes there is need to be passionate about everything. “At the end of the day, only the strong will keep on fighting and give birth to their pregnant dreams. Purpose is the original intent for the creation of a person or the thing; the specific function of somebody or a thing,” he said. He said the book was a true reflection of his life.
