Ms Mushayanyama By Cyril Mushambi In a first of its kind, Rubies Modelling Agency is breaking boundaries and trying to reach out to the girls in Harare and later in the whole of Zimbabwe with a unique initiative. This time it is by way of the Zone 5 Modelling pageant which calls out to girls in Warren Park, Kambuzuma, Lochinvar, Kuwadzana and Dzivaresekwa to showcase their modelling skills and hone their catwalk skills. Rubies Modelling Agency will be hosting auditions for the girls in the aforementioned townships on the January 27 at 1 O’clock in the afternoon in Warren Park at the Danborough College (near Pfukwa). The auditions will pick 20 finalists who will participate at the Miss Zone Five Modelling pageant which will be held on February 25 this year. “Registration will be done on the day of the auditions and for one to qualify to be a participant she must be between the age of 18 and 23 and auditioning is free but participants should bring a copy of their national ID or anything equals to that,” said one of the directors of the event, Ms Anea Mushayanyama. Simbarashe Mandizvidza another of the organisers of the pageant explained the purpose of this pageant; “We are aiming to find talent in Zimbabwe in modelling and through that we are trying to protect the girl child from abusing drugs by offering an artistic alternative. We want to thwart the desires to indulge in unnecessary sexual encounters as well. In short we want to educate, empower, support, transform, and protect the girl child in Zimbabwe through the event,” he said. The pageant will have the rallying theme “Developing African pride in the girl child” hence it will be more of a reminder to the girl child of her culture and traditions and enhancing the pride of being a girl in our society
