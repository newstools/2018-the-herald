Romeo Gasa Arts Correspondent Sungura musician Romeo has branded and is determined to change his fortunes this year. As part of his projects of the year, he has lined up a new album that he will market at most of his shows. The yet-to-be-named album has seven tracks and is being recorded at Diamond Studios. Gasa said he could not release a new album last year as he was working on his new brand and this year he will unveil the new product. “We have decided to take our time because we want to come out with a quality project that will win hearts of many,” he said. He said the album was worth waiting for and they will be sampling new songs at their various shows. Tonight he performs at Time and Jazz Café at his usual Thursday slot and tomorrow he will be at new Club Veritas in Westlea. “Our Thursday shows are doing well and we are happy with the response. We have started sampling new songs at the shows and we are recording the new album. We have held shows in Westlea for several times and we are humbled by the turnout of fans. I want to thank promoters that are gaining confidence in us as a band,” he said. Josh Hozheri of Time and Jazz said they are happy with the progress they have made so far. He is optimistic that the slot will take Gasa to another level. Club Veritas owner Edward Mtukwa said he was happy to be hosting the young musician. “We are simply answering people’s calls to have the musician performing at the venue. People have been calling for the musician to come for a show,” he said.
