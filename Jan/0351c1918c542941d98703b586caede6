CAPE TOWN. — South Africa’s Minister of Sport and Recreation Thulas Nxesi plans to boycott the upcoming Davis Cup tie between South Africa and Israel. The tie is scheduled for this weekend at the Irene Country Club outside Pretoria. Israel visiting these shores has drawn criticism from various organisations due to the political situation in the country. Via a Press statement released on Friday, Nxesi compared the current political situation in Israel to that of the old Apartheid system in South Africa. “Our own Human Sciences Research Council, in 2009, produced a report documenting how Israel is practicing Apartheid in the Occupied Palestinian Territories,” Nxesi said. — Sport24
