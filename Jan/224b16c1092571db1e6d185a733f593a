Youths are shunning ARVs due to stigma Sukoluhle Ndlovu Midlands Correspondent THE National Aids Council (NAC) has raised concern over an increase in the number of young people in Gweru who are defaulting on antiretroviral treatment (ART) due to stigma. In an interview, NAC Gweru District Aids coordinator Mr Murari Hwingwiri said a number of youths were afraid of seeking treatment from health centres due to stigma. “Defaulting on ART is very rampant among young people due to various reasons, which include stigma and discrimination. Others stop taking their medication due to fear of disclosure, while others listen to prophets who claim to cure the virus,” he said. “Some are told by their parents or guardians that they have to take medicines because they have heart or kidney ailments, so when they don’t feel sick they don’t take their medication. That stops us from winning the war against HIV and Aids.” Mr Hwingwiri said new HIV infections in the 15 to 24 age groups were increasing, a situation he described as worrisome. “Statistics show that new HIV infections in the 15 to 24 age groups are increasing,” he said. “The 2016 HIV estimates report shows that Midlands province has the highest number of new HIV infections cases.” Mr Hwingwiri said NAC was joining forces with artists and musicians in an anti-stigma campaign. “This year we will join forces with the Ministry of Health and Child Care and artists in anti-stigma campaign aimed at sensitising the community on issues relating to HIV and Aids,” he said.
