He was at large for over nine years, and dodged the police by changing his appearances regularly. Abdul is known to be associated with the banned organisation in India — the Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI)-Indian Mujahidden (IM). A qualified engineer, he is also understood to have worked with top Indian IT companies located in Bengaluru (capital city of southern state Karnataka) and Hyderabad (capital of southern state Telangana). According to police sources, the nabbed terrorist was also wanted by the country’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with terror attacks in Delhi and Bengaluru in the past, and the 2006 Mumbai local train bombings.  Abdul was often dubbed as “India’s Bin Laden” for his art of changing his appearances and giving the slip to cops on a number of occasions. – Xinhua
