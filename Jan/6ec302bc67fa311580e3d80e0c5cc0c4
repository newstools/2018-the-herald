MADRID. — Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane on Wednesday confirmed that he has signed a contract extension which will keep him at the European soccer champions until 2020. “It’s signed,” said the French star after his side drew 2-2 with Numancia to progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey 5-2 on aggregate. After a dream start at Real, with eight trophies out of a possible 10, Zidane has endured a tough season with his side 16 points behind Barcelona in the La Liga title race. And the 45-year-old cautioned: “I’m enjoying what I do every day, because that’s the way it is. I can’t imagine myself as a coach in two, three years, because things are not like that. “I know how it goes, nothing more, even with this contract it does not change anything.” On Wednesday, Real fielded an almost unrecognisable team and struggled into the Copa del Rey last-eight. Zidane could afford to rest his superstars with one eye on La Liga and the Champions League last 16 with a clash against Paris Saint-Germain next month.However, they were far from convincing at the Bernabeu. Lucas Vazquez scored both of Real’s goals after the 11th and 59th minutes. — AFP.
