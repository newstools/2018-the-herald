LONDON. — Pierra-Emerick Aubameyang arrived at Arsenal’s training ground yesterday ahead of his expected £55m switch from Borussia Dortmund. The 28-year-old boarded a private jet from Germany to Luton Airport. Aubameyang gave the game away when he was spotted unloading his Range Rover at Dortmund Airport yesterday morning. After boarding a short flight, the 28-year-old headed straight for the Gunners base. He is expected to finalise personal terms of the transfer before the transfer window deadline today. Although the two clubs have agreed on a fee, Dortmund will not let the striker go until they find a replacement — according to Sky sources. Arsene Wenger had two bids rejected for the Gabon star, before the figure was agreed at £55m. He is expected to pocket around £180 000-a-week at the Emirates. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud had been linked with a move to the Bundesliga side after the Aubameyang deal was agreed. But the French ace is understood to be keen on staying in England for family reasons. Fans have already had the 28-year-old’s name printed on to the back of their Arsenal shirts. And they have jumped to the conclusion that he will adopt the honour of wearing number 14 — made famous by Thierry Henry —The Sun.
