RABAT. – Cote d’Ivoire and Morocco share the same vision on the management of migration in Africa, Cote d’Ivoire’s Minister of African Integration and Ivorians Abroad, Ally Coulibaly said here on Thursday. “We have a convergence of views regarding the migration issue and we share the same vision on solutions that should be brought to manage this phenomenon,” Coulibaly told the press following talks with the Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita. The two countries believe that “only a co-operation between the countries of departure, transit and destination is likely to enable us to find solutions to this key issue on the African agenda,” he stressed. He also commended Morocco’s leading role in facilitating the elaboration of a common African agenda on migration. Earlier this month, Morocco hosted the ministerial conference for an African agenda on migration as part of consultations between African states to elaborate a draft African agenda on migration in the upcoming African Union (AU) Summit in Addis Ababa scheduled in January. Since last March, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI has been in charge of coordinating the migration issue within the AU. Regarding bilateral ties, the Ivorian minister said Abidjan and Rabat have “an exemplary partnership.” The two countries enjoy close ties as evidenced by top level exchange of visits. Morocco’s king has visited Cote d’Ivoire five times since the coming to power of President Alassane Ouattara in 2011. At the economic level, Moroccan investments in Cote d’Ivoire in 2016 reached $213 million, making Morocco the largest source of foreign investment in the country. – Xinhua.
