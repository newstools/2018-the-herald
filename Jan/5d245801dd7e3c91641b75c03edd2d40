Sports Reporter IT’S set to be a full house today when Division One netball teams from across the country meet at Stodart Netball Complex in Mbare for this year’s promotional play-offs into the Super League. The tournament being hosted by the Zimbabwe Netball Association (ZINA) is expected to feature over 20 teams. They will battle it out for the four slots up for grabs into the national league. While there are four guaranteed places into the top league following the relegation of the bottom four teams, there may be more slots depending on the number of clubs able to compete in the league as there are other factors such as financial challenges that may affect them. Some of the teams that have confirmed their participation include Flow Angels, UZ, ZRP Chinhoyi, Lupane State University and Dolphins.
