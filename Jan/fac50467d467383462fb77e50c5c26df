LONDON. — Anthony Joshua warned Joseph Parker that it will take “more than a human” to defeat him ahead of their world heavyweight boxing title unification clash. The WBA “super” and IBF title holder responded to claims by WBO king Parker and his promoter David Higgins at the first press conference for their fight at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff on March 31. Higgins has questioned Joshua’s chin, pointing to past knock-downs that had been suffered by the unbeaten 28-year-old, but AJ quickly referred to each occasion and ruled out a knock-out win for Parker. “When you talk about myself getting dropped and what you done, it’s a marketability strategy,” said Joshua. “When you want to talk about facts — the three times that I have been hurt or dropped was in the European Championships when McCracken knows I was actually banned from the GB team, because I was still getting in trouble. “I stopped boxing and two weeks before that European Championship, I was called up to the country. I was very unfit, I didn’t get dropped. I got stopped. When your tank is empty, it’s hard to perform. “The second time was David Price. I had come out of a police cell the day I went up to training. I’m not going to use it as an excuse, but David Price is a puncher, and lack of experience. “With Klitschko, all those times it told me, it will take more than a human to stop me from where I’m destined to be, and that’s what I learnt. — Sky Sports.
