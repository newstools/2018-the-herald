Alexis Sanchez LONDON. — Sky in Italy are reporting Manchester United want to sign Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal and have made contact with his representatives. United are thought to be willing to consider involving midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan in a swap deal for the Chile international. Sky in Italy also understand United are ready to pay more than Manchester City for Sanchez and would give him a higher wage. Sky Sports News – who have contacted Manchester United for their reaction – have received no information to suggest Arsenal have had a formal offer for the player at this stage. According to Sky in Italy, City already have a financial package in place for Sanchez should he leave Arsenal in the summer when his contract expires. The potential deal would earn Sanchez £13m a year in wages, with the 29-year-old receiving a £30m signing-on-fee. Sky Sports News understands City are still keen on signing Sanchez but may wait until the summer to avoid upsetting the balance of the squad which boasts a 15-point lead at the top of the English Premier League. Pep Guardiola’s side made a £60m Deadline Day approach for Sanchez, however, the deal collapsed when Arsenal were unable to sign Thomas Lemar as a replacement from Monaco. Arsenal have now scheduled a meeting with Bordeaux to discuss a potential deal for Brazilian forward Malcom, Sky in Italy are reporting. The 20-year-old, who is also wanted by arch-rivals Tottenham this month, has emerged as an option to potentially replace Alexis Sanchez should he leave for Manchester City either this month, or in the summer. French club Bordeaux are believed to value Malcom at over £40m, and he is also reportedly of interest to Bayern Munich and Manchester United. Malcom posted on social media last week that he was learning English, suggesting he was preparing himself for a move across the channel. — Sky Sports.
