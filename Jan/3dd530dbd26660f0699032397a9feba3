Victoria Ruzvidzo in Madrid, Spain African tourism ministers have welcomed the new dispensation in Zimbabwe saying the country is now poised to reaise its full potential as a tourist destination. In separate interviews here yesterday, the ministers said the smooth intervetion by the military and the coming into power by President Mnangagwa created a fertile environment for tourism and the revival of the economy as a whole. Untied Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) chairman of the Convention of African Ministers Najib Balala said Zimbabwe was now on the right track. “We want to thank Zimbabwe for a smart transition. We now need to come together as a continent and address issues of govenance, peace and democracy. These have been repelling visitors. They make Africa a hard sell,” he said. Gambia Tourism and Culture Minister Hamat Bah said what happened in Zimbabwe was a lesson to be learnt by others. “Zimbabwe was never a crisis before. It was largely exaggerated. We are excited about the new dispensation. We encourage this new dispensation to have a spirit of reconciliation because unity fosters tourism,” he said. UNWTO director African Regional Programmes Elcia Grandcourt also commended President Mnangagwa for his hardwork and commitment to transform the economy.
