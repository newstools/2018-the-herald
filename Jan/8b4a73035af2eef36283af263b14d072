MELBOURNE. — South Korean tennis star Chung Hyeon dumped six-time champion Novak Djokovic out of the Australian Open yesterday in a sensational fourth round upset. The 21-year-old beat the battle-weary Serb, who was clearly in pain as he stretched for balls, 7-6 (7/4), 7-5, 7-6 (7/3) in 3 hours 21 minutes in a night match on Rod Laver Arena. Chung, the first South Korean man to reach the round of 16 at the Australian Open, will face American bolter Tennys Sandgren in the quarter-finals tomorrow. Two years ago Djokovic outclassed Chung in straight sets in the opening round of the Australian Open, but the South Korean spectacularly reversed the result with three hard-fought sets against the wounded Serb in the fourth round. Djokovic, who sought treatment for his troublesome right elbow and an apparent hip injury when stretching for a ball, battled through in great discomfort, as Chung stayed composed and mentally tough to claim his biggest win. “I didn’t know if I was going to win this match tonight, but I was just honoured to play with Novak again,” said Chung. “When I was young I was trying to copy Novak because he’s my idol. I can’t believe this, dreams come true tonight.” — AFP.
