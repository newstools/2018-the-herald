Minister Gumbo Blessings Chidakwa Correspondent Government has this year allocated over $9 million for the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme (ERRP) in Mashonaland West, an increase from last year’s $8,3 million. The funds are part of this year’s Zimbabwe National Roads Administration’s (Zinara) $232 million allocated for road maintenance and rehabilitation projects countrywide. Addressing district administrators and heads of local authorities from Mashonaland West Province in Chinhoyi recently, Transport and Infrastructure Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo said each local authority had received its share depending on the proposals it made to Government. He said those who had changed priorities were free to inform his ministry for adjustments. “Chinhoyi Municipality and Chirundu Local Board are allocated an equal $947 125 and Kadoma got $1 million. Chegutu Rural District Council also received $550 862, Hurungwe $564 557, Sanyati $508 883, Makonde $508 655 and Mhondoro was allocated $508 413.” “Nyaminyami got $509 107, Zvimba $600 000, Chegutu Municipality $883 101, Banket $529 906, Kariba Urban $715 000, Karoi $715 662 and Norton $738 085.” Dr Gumbo implored local authorities to always consult with Members of Parliament in their respective areas and called for greater cooperation among community leaders. “If you are one of such rogue element stop that immediately as we will not hesitate to deal with you. Since Operation Restore Legacy started 26 Ministers have fallen by the way side. Let us learn to work together, you should in fact set your priorities together.” Dr Gumbo applauded the province for putting to good use a disbursement of $8,3 million under the same fund. “My ministry would like to commend the province for undertaking the following projects under ERRP being funded by Zinara. Rehabilitation of 4.5km of the Harare-Chirundu Road and 2.5km of Alaska-Copper Queen Road.” “The resealing of 5km along the Kariba-Makuti Road, 8.1km in Chinhoyi central business district, Kadoma CBD and Chegutu roads respectively.” “Repairs of Mupfure Bridge along Mubaira-Skyline Road and installation of two sets of traffic lights.”
