Total deaths increased to 1 838 in 2017 from 1 721 in 2016, notching a 7 percent increase. Those injured from traffic accidents were, however, less in 2017 as the year recorded 10 489 injuries compared to the previous year’s 11 379, a modest 8 percent decline. In all the accidents that were recorded, the statement noted that 1 358 were fatal compared to those of 2016, which cumulatively amounted to 1 291. The TSCZ further noted that most accidents happened in Harare Metropolitan Province, where 23 140 accidents were recorded compared to 2016’s 20 124, a 15 percent increase.
