DORMUND. — Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was booed by his own fans and told he can leave Borussia Dortmund if Arsenal meet the asking price, the German club’s director of sport Michael Zorc confirmed on Saturday. Having been dropped for the last two matches, Aubameyang made his first start for a month in Dortmund’s 2-2 Bundesliga draw at home to Freiburg. He headed over the bar in the first-half with his single effort in a performance so poor that he was even booed by home fans for each of his 19 touches. “No player is bigger than our club,” said a banner unfurled by angry Dortmund supporters. Dortmund have reportedly rejected a second bid by Arsenal of €58 million with the German club thought to be holding out for €70 million for their top-scorer. “We know that Aubameyang wants to leave,” said Zorc. “We must not forget that he is already in his fifth year in Dortmund. “We have made it clear that we are ready to realise a transfer when our wishes are completely fulfilled. Arsenal has made several attempts so far and we have rejected them.” — AFP.
