LA JOLLA. — Tiger Woods capped an encouraging return to PGA Tour action with an even-par 72 on Sunday at the Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament. The former world number one was tied for 27th when he walked off his final green, the par-five ninth, on a Torrey Pines South Course where Woods’s eight victories include his 14th and most recent major title at the 2008 US Open. “Today I played a lot better,” said Woods, who had four birdies and four bogeys in a round that gave him a three-under par total of 285. It was tough conditions out there,” he added of the gusting winds. “It was tough scoring.” Woods was playing his first US tour event since missing the cut at Torrey Pines last year. He had missed all of 2016 with back trouble, and his comeback bid last year was cut short by recurring pain and spinal fusion surgery in April. Woods hit just 17 of 56 greens all week, but he displayed a deft touch around the greens and solid putting to bring it in under par. Most importantly, there was no sign of any back trouble as he looks ahead to his next scheduled start at Riviera in Los Angeles February 15-18. “Very pleased,” said Woods, who hadn’t made the cut in a PGA Tour event since his tie for 10th at the Wyndham Championship in August of 2015. “After not playing for a couple of years to come out here on the Tour and really play a solid four days – I fought hard for these scores.” Woods said before the tournament that his expectations were “tempered.” But after rounds of 72-71-70 he said he went out on Sunday – clad in his traditional final-round red and black – with an ambitious number in mind. “I wanted to shoot something around 65 – thought that would be a playoff number,” Woods said. For the first time all week, Woods put his opening tee shot in the fairway en route to a par at the 10th. — AFP.
