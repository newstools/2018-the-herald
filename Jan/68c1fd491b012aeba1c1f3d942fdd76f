MANCHESTER. – Alexis Sanchez insists Manchester United are the biggest club in England and says he nearly moved to Old Trafford when Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge. The Chilean completed his move from Arsenal on Monday, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan heading to the Emirates as part of a swap deal, and will wear the iconic No 7 shirt at Old Trafford. Sanchez spent three-and-a-half-years at Arsenal and it appeared as though he was heading to Manchester City before Pep Guardiola’s side ended their interest in the 29-year-old due to costs, but Sanchez insists he has always dreamed of playing for United and believes he has signed for the biggest club in England. “Since I was a young lad, I’ve always said that my dream was to play for Manchester United and I’m not just saying that because I’m here now and today, it’s come true,” he told MUTV. “I always said as a kid that I’d like to play for United and I once spoke to Sir Alex Ferguson about it. We chatted for around 20 minutes. And I told him that my dream was to come here to Manchester United. – Sky Sports.
