MADRID. — Real Madrid crashed to a humiliating Copa del Rey exit on Wednesday night when they were knocked out by little Leganes in the quarter-finals with under-fire coach Zinedine Zidane taking the blame. European champions Real lost 2-1 in the second leg at their Bernabeu home as the tie finished 2-2 on aggregate with their modest city neighbours going through on away goals despite having lost the first leg 1-0 last week. “I am responsible for all of this. It’s a failure for me,” said Zidane who recently penned a contract extension until 2020. Admitting that it had been his worst night as a coach, the Frenchman added: “It’s a logical result, our opponents played their match and we did not. “It is a big blow. We did what we had to do in the first leg. Nobody expected this, especially me but this is football. — AFP.
