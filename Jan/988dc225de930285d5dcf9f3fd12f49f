LONDON. — Eden Hazard has reportedly agreed to join Spanish soccer giants Real Madrid at the end of the season after snubbing Chelsea’s offers of a new deal. Zinedine Zidane is desperate to bolster his attacking ranks this month having seen his side fall 16 points behind Barcelona in La Liga. Hazard is the name at the top of his wishlist, while club president Florentino Perez remains a long-term admirer of his. And according to Radio Monte Carlo, Los Blancos have held talks with Hazard over a transfer. They claim the Belgian has already rejected two offers from Chelsea over extending his stay – his current deal runs until 2020. One proposal saw Hazard offered a staggering €17.6m (£15.5m) a season but Hazard is holding out for a move to the Bernabeu. Spanish publication AS claim Hazard has his heart set on a switch to Spain and following discussions has now agreed to leave Chelsea in the summer. For that reason, Hazard doesn’t want to sign the new contract Chelsea have offered him. It remains to be seen whether Chelsea will agree to sell to Madrid though and any fee would likely be well over the £100m mark. Last month Eden’s father, Thierry Hazard, revealed the winger had rejected Chelsea’s offer and hinted he was holding out for an approach from the European champions. “What I can reveal about Eden is that he refused a contract extension. This was so that, if necessary, he could follow the interest of Real, whom he could see himself playing for. As of right now, there is no contact from Real Madrid. Eden is only one of the parties involved in his future,” he said. Hazard recently gave Chelsea fans hope he was keen on extending his stay in west London but only if Thibaut Courtois penned a new deal first. The shot-stopper, who has also been linked with a switch to Madrid, had previously urged his Belgium team-mate to sign on the dotted line. “I will answer you the same as Thibaut,” Hazard told French media. — Daily Express-Sky Sports.
