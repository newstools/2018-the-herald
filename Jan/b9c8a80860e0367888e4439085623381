Romeo Gasa Arts Correspondent Musician Romeo Gasa continues with his mission of taking sungura to another level when he performs at Club Iridium tonight. Since last year, the musician has been lining up shows for upmarket and downtown venues to ensure the reach of the genre cuts across social classes. Gasa is one of the young sungura musicians with loads of potential and he says his mission is to lead other young artistes in ensuring that the genre does not die. His Thursday “Executive Sungura” shows at Time and Jazz Café have become popular and he intends to get more slots at venues close to the city centre. His show at Club Iridium tonight is one of such gigs. “I believe sungura is the best genre in the country. It is a genre that has stood the test of time and many big names in the industry made it through sungura. We should not let the genre go down. There are many genres that tried to bring down sungura but fell by the wayside. I want to be part of a generation that will take sungura to another level,” said Gasa. He promised to give fans a memorable show tonight and challenged them to beat ‘January disease’ to have fun. “I know it is January and people might be complaining about depleted pockets. The venue owners have promised to have some specials for merrymakers in order to cushion them against January disease. We say every time is party time and nothing should stop us from having fun.” An official at Club Iridium said the joint is now under new management and they intend to change the face of showbiz. “The place changed hands at the beginning of the year. 2018 will be a different year at Iridium. The new proprietors want to change the game and make sure that the venue brings another dimension to showbiz,” said the official.
