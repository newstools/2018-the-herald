Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Health reporter Government will continue investing in the National Blood Services Zimbabwe (NBSZ) despite challenges the entity is facing and will work towards the amicable resolution of differences between the board and donors, a Government official has said. Addressing journalists in Harare yesterday at a Press conference held as a precursor to the organisation’s emergency general meeting (EGM), permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Major-General Dr Gerald Gwinji (Retired) said the organisation was facing governance issues which had nothing to do with its operations. “There have been challenges in the board, but that doesn’t translate to challenges in the operations of the entity, but left for too long, it can then translate to that,” said Dr Gwinji. “We are facing a few challenges that we need to deal with. The EGM has been called, it has got an agenda and that agenda from the ministry’s perspective addresses the major issues at hand.” Dr Gwinji said the EGM, which has been slated for February 3, 2018, was expected to pave way for Government to better manage the NBSZ, a situation that was likely to see the price of blood dropping further to $10 a pint. “So, we believe the EGM will pave the way forward for us to better govern the NBSZ and the ordinary sessions of the annual general meeting will address other issues further as we go,” said Dr Gwinji. NBSZ vice board chairman Mr Elliot Mugamu said the EGM agenda was drafted in accordance with the law.
