Africa Moyo Business Reporter The Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) has stopped directly collecting the Passenger Service Charge and the Aviation Infrastructure Development Fund (AIDEF) from all passengers departing on Air Zimbabwe flights. CAAZ will stop collecting the departure taxes – which are pegged at $15 for domestic destinations and $50 for regional routes – with effect from tomorrow. The travellers have raised concerns that purchasing departure tickets separately was an unnecessary inconvenience. Since November 2014, CAAZ has been collecting the PSC and AIDEF amid allegations that Air Zimbabwe was no longer remitting the funds, which are crucial in the development of aviation infrastructure. Without divulging details, CAAZ yesterday said in 2014, it had become necessary for it to directly collect the PSC and AIDEF, instead of allowing Air Zimbabwe to do it on its behalf. “However, following wide consultations and in the spirit of ‘ease of doing business’, the CAAZ is pleased to inform the public that with effect from 1 February 2018, all Air Zimbabwe issued tickets will include the PSC and AIDEF and other codes CB and XI will appear on the ticket. “All Air Zimbabwe passengers who would have bought air tickets on and after 1 February 2018 will not be required to buy departure coupons from CAAZ. We wish to express our sincere gratitude to all members of the travelling public who have been patient and understanding over the past three years,” said CAAZ in a statement. Government had initially ordered CAAZ to resolve its dispute with Air Zimbabwe over departure taxes by end of March last year, saying it was inconveniencing Air Zimbabwe passengers.
