Takudzwa Chiwereweshe Manicaland Correspondent The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) has deployed 20 teams in Manicaland to undertake the biometric voter registration (BVR) mop up exercise. The mop up exercise, which started on January 10 is targeting people who failed to register during the initial BVR blitz that ended on December 19 last year, and aliens who were not eligible during that time. ZEC Manicaland province deputy elections officer Mr Thompson Chiwereweshe said they had deployed 20 teams to cover the province. “Voter educators have been deployed to educate voters about the programme, documents required to register and the dates the teams will visit their centres,” he said. Mr Chiwereweshe urged the public to participate in the mop up exercise. “The programme is targeting individuals who were unable to register during the blitz,” he said. “The intervention also targets aliens who were unable to participate during the exercise. “The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission is encouraging all those who did not get a chance to register during the just ended blitz.” Mr Chiwereweshe said the mop up exercise is expected to end on February 8. He said there would be 250 mobile registration centres, with eight static centres across the province. “The mop up exercise will be in seven districts, which include Chipinge, Chimanimani, Nyanga, Mutasa, Makoni, Buhera and Mutare,” said Mr Chiwereweshe. “There are 250 mobile registration centres and eight static centres. “Twenty teams have been deployed to cover the 250 registration centres.”
