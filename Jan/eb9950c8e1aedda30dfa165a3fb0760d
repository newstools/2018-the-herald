Munashe Matambo and Tanaka Makuwaza Property Reporters Aluminium demand has been increasing as most new home builders now prefer its products as compared to steel. Director of Alumex Glass and Aluminium Designs, Mr Francis Sunday told The Herald Property Guide that the company has lately experienced a high demand in aluminium products. An estimated 70 percent of the new home builders are preferring aluminium windows and door frames as compared to steel products. “Aluminuim looks beautiful plus it is resistant to rust,” he said. A salesman at Alusequre and Frameless Glass Concepts, Mr Stanely Chikwena also added that, “aluminium demand is high because there are many people building and want their houses to look modern.” New home designs such as suspended ceilings, sliding doors and stained glass encourage new home owners to favour aluminium over steel. Industry players also say that the minimum design service life of aluminium buildings is 80 years and, it can be used in any climatic conditions.
