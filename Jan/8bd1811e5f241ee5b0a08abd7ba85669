LONDON. — Pep Guardiola saw his Manchester City side pushed hard before defeating second-tier Bristol City in an entertaining League Cup semi-final on Tuesday night to leave him one game away from winning his first major trophy in English football. Guardiola’s runaway English Premier League leaders, eyeing an unprecedented season quadruple given they also remain involved in both the FA Cup and Champions League, won 3-2 on the night for a 5-3 aggregate win over the Championship side. And Guardiola declared himself happy after Manchester City saw off Bristol City to reach the Carabao Cup final on Tuesday night. An entertaining clash at Ashton Gate saw Guardiola’s side win 3-2 to secure a 5-3 aggregate victory over two legs of their semi-final. “We’re so happy to be there and for everyone involved at the club to reach this final,” he told Sky Sports. “We played an amazing game until 2-0 and then we lost control, and in these kinds of games it’s never easy until the end. “But it will be a good lesson for us next Sunday in Cardiff and especially in the Champions League, in these kinds of situations to (play for) 90 minutes. “In the first half we missed the last pass and we couldn’t be more precise with more accuracy.” — Sky Sports.
