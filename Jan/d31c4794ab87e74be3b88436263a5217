LONDON. — New Manchester United signing Alexis Sanchez could make his debut against Yeovil Town in the FA Cup fourth round tonight, before Tottenham Hotspur will be out to avoid an upset against another fourth-tier side in Newport County a day later. Having missed Arsenal’s third-round defeat at Nottingham Forest, United’s new No. 7 avoided being cup-tied for the remainder of this season’s competition, and could feature at Huish Park in Jose Mourinho’s 100th match in charge. The trip to Somerset will be familiar to some United fans, after the 12-time FA Cup winners, under former manager Louis van Gaal, laboured to a 2-0 success over Yeovil in the third round in January 2015. Having been pushed all the way by Bristol City in their League Cup semi-final second leg victory earlier this week, Engl;ish Premier League leaders Manchester City face another Championship side in Cardiff City on Sunday. — Reuters.
