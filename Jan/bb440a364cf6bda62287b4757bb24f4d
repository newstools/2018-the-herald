Takudzwa Chiwereweshe Mutare Correspondent A 19-year-old student with Alpha Institute in Mutare yesterday appeared in court for bedding a 15-year-old girl, twice. Lovemore Nderere appeared before magistrate Mr Innocent Bepura who remanded him out of custody on free bail pending trial on January 22. The State, led by prosecutor Ms Christine Mwenga, alleged that Nderere knowingly had sex with the under-aged girl on December 29 and 30 last year, at his grandfather’s home. Nderere, however, claimed he was deceived by the girl, who told him that she was above the stipulated 16 years, when the relationship started in September last year. He did not deny having sex with the girl.
