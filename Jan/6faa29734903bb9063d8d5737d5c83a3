Mukudzei Chingwere Midlands Bureau THE football fraternity has been plunged into mourning again following the untimely death of Chapungu goalkeeper Roy Mazingi. Mazingi died in Harare after a short illness at the age of 31. Chapungu public relations officer Tawanda Zowa confirmed the death of their player. “It is with great sorrow that we as Chapungu FC announce the death of our first choice goalkeeper Roy Mazingi. Roy passed away last night (Wednesday) in Harare after a short illness. Mourners are gathered at house number 537 Mbizo 3, Kwekwe. “Burial will be in Kwekwe on Saturday (tomorrow),” said Zowa. Death has struck again at the club which lost their former goalkeeper Brighton Muchambo who died at the age of 41 last February. Chapungu coach Tendai Chikuni described the death of Mazingi as a blow to the team and the Chapungu family. “Last year we lost Brighton and now it’s Roy. We are very saddened by the untimely death of Roy, he was a very disciplined player and the loss is quite big especially for us who have been working with him. “It is a big loss for us as a team he was the pillar of our team and he will be sadly missed,” said Chikuni. His former coach at Shabanie Mine Luke Masomere said he learnt of the goalkeeper’s death with shock. “I worked with him for a very long time from the time he was still a junior player and I promoted him to the senior team at Shabanie Mine. “It’s unfortunate that he has passed on at such a young age. I was also very close to him on a personal level and he is one of the players I interacted with even when I was out of football,” said Masomere. Former Chapungu gaffer John Nyikadzino said the game had been left poorer. “It is unfortunate to lose someone at such a young age. He was a well disciplined boy and his death has really touched us. He was someone I was sure that even after playing football he will be a good ambassador of the game unfortunately his life has been cut short,” said Nyikadzino.
