NEW DELHI. – Indian police yesterday said they have arrested a 42-year-old woman on charges of killing her teenage son, and then burning his body and dumping the charred remains near their home in the southern state of Kerala. The bone-chilling crime that has shocked the entire country took place in Kollam, over 65 km from state capital Thiruvananthapuram, earlier this week, but came to light later only after the woman, identified as Jaya Mol, broke down during sustained interrogation by police. Kollam’s police chief A. Sreenivas said that Mol had allegedly lost her temper during an argument with her 14-year-old son and strangled him with a dupatta in a fit of rage. – Xinhua.
