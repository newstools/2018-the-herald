Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) have said there is need to take sport to a level where the country can compete for medals at international events instead of just making the numbers. The remarks were made by ZOC president Admire Masenda when he led his board to pay a courtesy call on the Minister of Sport, Arts and Recreation Kazembe Kazembe at his offices in Harare yesterday. ZOC took the opportunity to appraise the minister on various issues including the National Olympics’ structure and major events lined up for this year – the African Youth Games scheduled for July in Algiers, Algeria, and the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) set for October in Buenos Aires, Argentina. For most of the sporting disciplines, the continental Games in Algiers are serving as the qualifier to the YOG in Argentina. And most of the young aspiring athletes are busy working on qualification to the Games.
