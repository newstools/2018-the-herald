MOSCOW. — Russia on Wednesday slammed the United States for accusing it of being involved in a chemical attack in eastern Syria, calling in “unacceptable”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow does not agree with Washington’s approach to investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, local media reported. “We categorically disagree with the approach of the Americans, who are following the path of derailing real international investigations of previous cases, and prefer to stick labels groundlessly,” Peskov told the press. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Tuesday said Russia might be connected to the reported chemical attack in Syria’s Eastern Ghouta. Calling the statements “absolutely unacceptable” for Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov Wednesday said, “On this basis, we cannot work with the United States.” He hoped the US officials would cool down and gradually accustom themselves to a more adequate perception of “what is happening around, including the proposals made by the Russian side.” Russia on Tuesday proposed a new probe panel under the UN Security Council to determine the perpetrators of the chemical weapon attack in Syria, but the United States remained wary. A new round of peace talks on Syria is expected to take place in Vienna, Austria, today and tomorrow, while Russia will organize negotiations in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Jan. 29-30, to find a way to end the nearly seven-year conflict in Syria. – Xinhua
