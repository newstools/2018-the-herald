LONDON. — Farhad Moshiri has claimed that Romelu Lukaku refused to sign a contract extension at Everton after the soccer striker’s mother got a “voodoo” message telling him to go to Chelsea. Moshiri, the club’s major shareholder, also said that he “wasted” two summers trying to persuade the Belgium international to stay at Goodison Park. Chelsea ended up missing out on Lukaku as well, with Manchester United securing the forward in July in a deal believed to be worth £75 million, although Moshiri argued that Everton effectively lost money because he would be worth significantly more now. In an extraordinary speech on Tuesday night at the club’s annual general meeting, before an audience of shareholders at Liverpool’s Philharmonic Hall, the Iranian businessman spoke openly about his unsuccessful attempts to persuade Lukaku and Ross Barkley to stay the club. — AFP.
