TANGIERS. — Nigeria failed to claim a win as they drew 0-0 against Rwanda in their opening Group C match of the 2018 CAF African Nations Championship at the Stade Ibn Batouta in Tangiers, Morocco, on Monday. The stalemate leaves the Super Eagles placed at No 2. in the group on one point behind Libya, who earlier beat Equatorial Guinea 3-0. Nigeria’s next encounter is against the Mediterranean Knights on Friday. Despite a slow start, the Super Eagles pushed forward and hit the cross bar through Adelemi Faleye in the 10th minute with a header. Coach Salisu Yusuf’s men did all the right things in the match, but their decision making in the final third left a lot to be desired as Stephen Eze and Faleye missed two clear-cut opportunities. In the 40th minute Nigeria’s Rabiu Ali struck the cross bar with a fantastic strike from a long distance. The Nigerians “scored” in the 58th minute through Eze after they were awarded a set-piece, but it was disallowed for off-side. Towards the last 20 minutes, the Amavubi grew in confidence and Eric Rutanga saw his curling effort from a set piece missing the top right corner by inches. In the 80th minute, Nigeria were unlucky not to score as Eze saw his well-taken header coming off the left post once again. There were no goals as the clash ended goalless. — AFP.
