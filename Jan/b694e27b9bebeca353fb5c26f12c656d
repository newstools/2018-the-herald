Usain Bolt JOHANNESBURG. — Mamelodi Sundowns had a special guest in their training session on Monday morning at the South African Premiership soccer club’s base in Chloorkop — sprint legend Usain Bolt. The Jamaican trained with the Brazilians and imparted his knowledge on how to gain maximum speed with the club’s strikers. Bolt was at home with the 2016 African champions. The two sporting institutions, Bolt and Sundowns, share a sponsor in Puma and both have excelled in their respective codes — Bolt has eight Olympics gold medals and the Brazilians are chasing their eighth league title in the Premier Soccer League era. “Sundowns were pretty good,” Bolt said. “It was a good experience. I don’t know how quick I am with the ball but if I kick and run, I can get there. It was a good game. It was a fun day and they were welcoming. It’s just that the coach (Pitso Mosimane) told me that when I go back to Jamaica I need some training. I am very unfit, very, very unfit. “I am going to try and get fit for the trials with Borrusia Dortmund (in March). Training with Sundowns showed me that I am unfit for that. Getting in shape for me is easy. I told the coach that when I get to Jamaica I will call my coach Glen Mills and tell him that I need a month of training before I go on these trials.” Percy Tau supplied Bolt with the assist that led to the Jamaican scoring his only goal in the training session. “Thank you for coming to Sundowns,” Tau said to Bolt. “We really appreciate Puma. It was an honour to train with you. I think that you did well, you even scored. Thank you for coming. We enjoyed our moment with you.” — Supersport.com
