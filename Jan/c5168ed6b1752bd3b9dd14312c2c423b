LONDON. — Pep Guardiola pleaded for English soccer referees to protect football’s “artists” after Cardiff’s brutal treatment of Leroy Sane on Sunday — and even the German FA joined in. Manchester City star Sane could miss the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie against Basel and the Carabao Cup final clash with Arsenal because of an ankle injury after a horror tackle by Joe Bennett in Sunday’s FA Cup fourth-round win . After revealing German international Sane is set to be out for a month, Guardiola said: “The only thing they have to do is protect the players. Not (just) the Manchester City players – the players. “Protect the players. Or it will happen again. So please. For football in general. The players, they are the artists. You have to take care of them. That’s why you are here and why I’m here. Do I fear a player will be seriously injured? Of course. Not my players, the players in general. “Every team can play how they want. If they decide to play in that way, perfect. But there is one man, in black, he has to decide what is correct and incorrect.” The German FA’s official Twitter account posted: “Hey, @CardiffCityFC. Just letting you know, we have a really important tournament in the summer. Please don’t hurt our players. Thanks, #DieMannschaft #inSane.” Kevin de Bruyne netted an early free-kick before Raheem Sterling headed home his 19th goal of the season to keep Man City’s Quadruple bid alive as the Premier League leaders won through to Monday’s last-16 draw. But Guardiola added: “When you say, ‘Why don’t you win the four titles?’ I need the players to win the four titles. It is impossible for that to happen. When I said the Invincibles, that is not going to happen. The same. It is an illusion to think we can win all four. With this schedule it’s impossible.” — The Mirror
