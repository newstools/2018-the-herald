LIVERPOOL. — Pep Guardiola has challenged his Manchester City stars to use their dramatic 4-3 defeat at Liverpool as a warning to guard against complacency. Guardiola also insisted the Premier League title race is not over after his side slipped to a dramatic defeat by Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Guardiola’s side saw their 30-match unbeaten run in the English Premier League come to a stunning end at Anfield on Sunday night. The leaders fell behind to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s early opener and although Leroy Sane equalised before half-time, City were blown away by three goals in nine second half minutes from Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah. Although late goals from Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan put a flattering gloss on the score-sheet, City boss Guardiola had no complaints about his side’s first league defeat since April 5 at Chelsea. It was City’s first domestic defeat since an FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal on April 23. Conceding that all the talk of City winning the title at a canter and possibly going unbeaten throughout the entire season made it hard to keep his players motivated, the Spaniard said: “In every press conference for the last few months you have said that the Premier League is done. — AFP.
