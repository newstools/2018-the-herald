Michael Magoronga Midlands Correspondent Poor road network in some parts of the Midlands province is disturbing smooth flow of the ongoing BVR mop-up exercise as some places are inaccessible. The BVR mop-up exercise, which began on January 10, is expected to end on February 8. In an interview, Zanu-PF provincial chairperson, Cde Daniel Mackenzie Ncube, said the most affected areas were in Gokwe where teams were failing to access some areas. “We have places like Gumunyu and Goredema in Gokwe which are completely inaccessible due to bad roads,” he said. Cde Ncube said they were optimistic that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission team would reach out to the people given the ongoing dry spell which facilitates easy movement on dirty roads. “I think if it continues like this (without rains) it might make it easy for the teams to reach out to the people who are in those areas who are looking forward to voting in the coming elections,” said Cde Ncube. He said other than the bad road network, the exercise was going on smoothly as most people were bringing proper documentation as a result of voter education teams that went around before the registration mop-up teams were dispatched. Cde Ncube said at least four teams were on the ground, encouraging people to register.
