MANCHESTER. – English Premier League soccer leaders Manchester City received a boost on Monday with the news that influential midfielder Kevin De Bruyne has agreed to sign a new five-year contract with the club. The Belgian joined City from Wolfsburg in 2015, initially agreeing a six-year contract to stay in Manchester. However, his performances since, including 38 Premier League assists for City, have led to him being rewarded with a bumper new deal – announced at exactly the same time that rivals Manchester United heralded the signing of Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal. “I am really happy to have signed this new deal,” De Bruyne told the club’s website. “As I’ve said previously, my intention has always been to stay here at City, where I’ve felt at home from day one. Not only are we winning – we are playing great football. It’s a pleasure to be a part of and I’m really excited about what we can achieve in the coming years.” – Reuters.
