JOHANNESBURG. – The third Test between South Africa and India will resume on today despite fears over the Wanderers pitch, which was described as “dangerous” and caused an early stoppage yesterday, officials said. “The on-field umpires, in consultation with the match referee, and after speaking with both the captains and groundsmen, have decided that the Johannesburg Test will resume on time on Saturday (today),” said an International Cricket Council statement. Umpires Aleem Dar and Ian Gould, in consultation with match referee Andy Pycroft, took the players off the field earlier than scheduled on the third day after South African opener Dean Elgar was hit on the grille of his helmet by a short ball from India’s Jasprit Bumrah. – AFP.
