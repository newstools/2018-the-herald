Abigail Mawonde Herald Correspondent A Chinese delegation led by Inspur Group vice president Mr Peter Huang last Friday paid a courtesy call on Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Amon Murwira for discussions on High Performance Computing (HPC) projects in the country. Briefing the media after the meeting, Minister Murwira said phase two of the project will be commissioned before June this year. “We, as the Ministry Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development, are extremely pleased with the issue of the High Performance Computing Centre that we are kindly developing into the second phase. “One thing which is very important is that without information and information processing capability, it is very difficult for a nation to be efficient. So we are really very happy that the progress that we are making with the HPC will have national impact,” he said. Minister Murwira said Government will leverage on technology to come up with more programmes such as mineral exploration, data processing, climate modelling, genomics, artificial intelligence, geo-information science and information processing. “So we really are very thankful to this cooperation and we are very happy at the progress. In my view, I am expecting this project — this second phase — to have had progressed to the stage of commissioning by June this year. So we are really looking forward to a lot of progress. We are very positive as a Government and we are very positive as a Ministry that any technology that comes is the technology that we want to use to progress and to make sure that this country catapults itself into the family of the 21st century.”
