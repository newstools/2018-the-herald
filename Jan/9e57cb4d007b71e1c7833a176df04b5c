LONDON. — Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says there is “nothing concrete” yet regarding the possible transfer of Alexis Sanchez, despite reported interest from the Manchester clubs. Wenger has also admitted for the first time Arsenal are ready to sell Sanchez – but only if they get in a replacement. Manchester City are confident of signing Sanchez in the January window while Manchester United have come in with a rival bid for the Arsenal forward. But, while Wenger maintains it would be “normal” for Sanchez to stay until his contract elapses at the end of the season, he admitted that “nothing is decided one way or another”. The future of Sanchez has been the subject of much debate all season with the Chilean’s deal set to expire at the end season, putting Arsenal at risk of losing him on a free transfer. — Sky Sports.
