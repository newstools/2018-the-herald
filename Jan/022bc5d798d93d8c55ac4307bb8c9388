Jimmie Maleta Vongai Mbara Arts Reporter Chegutu-born hip hop artiste Jimmie Maleta has released a sizzling single titled “Shona Phansi (Get Down)”. The jam which was released on his birthday last week was produced by Nigerian producer Captain Blu. “Shona Phansi (Get down”) was launched during a boat cruise in Nigeria and it has received positive response from the public especially at hangout places where it is already on the playlists. Maleta, who is also known as Shasha Dze Hip-hop by his fans, is confident that the track will get to many merrymaking places and send people to the dance floor. “This song will get people grooving and flying high as we start off the new year with good vibes. It does not shy away from our African roots as the beat is mainly composed from traditional drums and bassline fused with an aggressive synth,” said Maleta. The hip-hop star recently did a collaboration with Burundian afro pop star Livien Mugenzi aka M Lee and Captain Blu on a track titled “Ulikwa Wapi” which is doing very well in and outside of the country. Maleta’s last release “Winner” featuring Tashley was good and he believes the sky is the limit to conquer the hip hop world with blistering jams. “I am trying to break the geographic isolation that people have on small towns. I was born and bred in Chegutu and people look down upon small towns and think there is no talent. I want to change that perception through music,” he said. Maleta is set to release his third album this year.
