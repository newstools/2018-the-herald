Andy Muridzo and Carlos Green Arts Correspondent Andy Muridzo and Carlos Green will stage a show to officially open new Club Veritas, formerly Pasi Bar, at Westlea Shops tonight. The Club owner Edward Mtukwa said they were overwhelmed by the number of patrons therefore decided to move to a bigger place. “We are moving to another bar just next to the old one because of the overwhelming response of the fans. We needed something big and we are happy that we managed to achieve that in a short space of time,” said Mutukwa. He said they wanted to maintain their relationship with their patrons and had responded to the requests. That will be another perfect opportunity for Muridzo and Carlos Green who have done a song together. “We decided to have the young stars on the official opening so that they reunite with their fans. Muridzo is one of the regular musicians here,” he said. He is optimistic that people will love the new set up. “After taking into consideration people’s concerns we then decided to have some consultations so that we can make a great bar that has some good standards,” he said. He said they will be giving all musicians equal opportunities to perform at this place. “We will be having several musicians coming to perform here and that is why we started with Carlos and Muridzo,” he said.
