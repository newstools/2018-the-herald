Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Boxing Control Board have once again been caught on the wrong side as two Malawian boxers who took part in the New Dawn tournament at City Sports Centre ended up sleeping at Roadport Bus Terminus for two days. The tournament promoted by a collaboration between Kalakoda Promotions and Kwesé Sport and the boxers were paid in local currency and encouraged to go to the black market to change their money. Obrey Masamba and Eleness Nkahlanti spent Sunday and Monday rocking the streets of Harare as they could not find a solution to their foreign currency woes. The two boxers lost their matches to local boxers with the former losing to Tinashe Madziwana in the super bantamweight category while the latter fell to Monalisa Sibanda in the female super lightweight. Businessman and former boxing promoter, Stalin Mau Mau, had no kind words for the boxing body which he described as a disgrace. “We thought we had learnt as a nation but it is the same old hymn we are singing. We did not expect this and the boxing mother body could have easily seen this coming. Surely, how can you not give athletes their dues and also encourage them to go to the black market? “We thought we had learnt something after Wilson Masamba faced the same challenge back in August last year. The rules are very clear that foreigners should be rewarded in foreign currency and I believe the contracts they sign clearly state that,” said Mau Mau. Other sources are also alleging that the Malawian boxers were not paid their full amounts with Masamba receiving $500 instead of $600 while Nkahlanti got $300 instead of $380. They were both paid in bond notes.
