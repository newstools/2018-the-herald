Mukudzei Chingwere Midlands Bureau NEW FC Platinum midfielder Never Tigere arrived with a bang at the champions with his coach, Norman Mapeza, praising him for a good debut show in a friendly match against Mozambican giants Ferroviario da Beira on Saturday. Even Warriors coach, Sunday Chidzambwa, who was his coach at ZPC Kariba, tipped the offensive midfielder for a bright future. Tigere introduced himself to the domestic Premiership with impressive performances at former Premiership side, Dongo Sawmills, where he was one of the standout players together with the likes Physwell Madhazi and Kudzai Chideu. The trio did not go down with Dongo when it was relegated. ZPC Kariba beat giants Dynamos to the signature of Tigere, with Madhazi and Chideu joining Bulawayo sides Chicken Inn and How Mine. Tigere produced a man-of-the-match performance that helped the miners to victory over the Mozambican giants and provided the assist to the only goal of the match. “The commitment from the players was there, which makes me happy. We have been doing much about physical training but obviously you will be telling players what you really want to achieve. “We were talking about how we want to defend and how we want to be going forward. I think you saw that with Never, I think you can tell that it is there, its coming up. He is gelling well with other players,” said Mapeza. Chidzambwa, who has worked with the midfielder before at ZPC Kariba, also spoke highly of the player. “He is a very talented player, it is difficult to point his weaknesses in football and he has a lot of potential. He has a very bright future if he really wants to be serious. I will say he is yet to reach his potential.
