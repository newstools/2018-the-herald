SAN JUAN DE MARCONA. — Two-time champion Nasser Al-Attiyah blew the field wide open at the Dakar Rally on Monday, powering his Toyota home four minutes faster than Stephane Peterhansel, although the Frenchman took the overall lead. Run over 500km of dirt and sand tracks through imposing Peruvian canyons from Pisco to San Juan de Marcona, the Qatari set the early pace opening a lead of two minutes after only 80km. Al-Attiyah won the opening stage on Saturday, but suffered badly on Sunday when his co-driver fell sick after just 15km. The Toyota driver, also an Olympic shooting medallist, won the Dakar in 2011 and 2015 and laid down a solid marker here as the Peugeots struggled to follow him home. “We needed to push, but not really crazily. The road really isn’t easy and is very dangerous in places,” the Qatari said. “There’s still a long way and we believe our Toyota Hilux is a very good car.” Dakar specialist Peterhansel enjoyed a solid day and climbs top of the overall standings by 03min 11sec from Sunday’s stage winner Cyril Despres, who lost almost eight minutes but avoided disaster and is second while Al-Attiyah storms up to third. — AFP.
