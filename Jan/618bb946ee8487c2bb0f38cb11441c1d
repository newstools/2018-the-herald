Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter FOOTBALLERS Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ) secretary-general Thomas Sweswe was happy with the high turnout on the first day of their Out-of-Contract players training camp which began at Motor Action Sports Club on Tuesday. With over 60 players turning out under the watchful eye of former Warriors coach Callisto Pasuwa, Sweswe said the response was impressive. Several former Premiership and lower division players are being afforded an opportunity to be noticed by coaches who will be scouting at this year’s edition of the programme which ends on Saturday. The programme camp is now in its fourth year and apart from the technical aspects of the game, a lot of emphasis will be put on awareness campaigns on drug abuse in sport and other issues. “We are very impressed as FUZ to have such a huge turnout for out of contract players and I hope the programme is going to help many of them. Dr Nicholas Munyonga will address the players on the importance of stopping drug abuse as the union has noted with great concern, the increase in drug abuse by players both male and female. “Players revealed the increased use of ‘bronco’, ‘diazepam’ and other drugs so the union wants to take this opportunity to raise awareness on the effects of drug abuse and instigate behavioural change in players. The players will be offered a comprehensive training programme which will conclude with friendly matches on the last day. Coaches from different clubs in the Premier Soccer League and the Division One are set to attend as out of contract players are presented with the platform to impress,” Sweswe said. Among the players who were at the training camp were former Dynamos, Highlanders and How Mine goalkeeper Munyaradzi Diya, Zivanai Mhanda, Terence Gonzo and Lloyd Majarira. The Bulawayo version of the training camp will run from January 16-20.
