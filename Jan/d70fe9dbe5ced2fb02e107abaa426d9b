ANTANANARIVO. – The death toll from a cyclone that hit Madagascar about 10 days ago has risen to 51, with another 22 people reported missing, authorities said on Sunday. Tropical Cyclone Ava passed through Madagascar on January 5-6, hitting mostly the eastern coast of the island with wind speeds of between 140-190 kph. The death toll had been put at about 29 people a week ago. The National Office of Risk and Disaster Management said in a statement on Sunday more 54,000 people were displaced by the cyclone. In March 2017, Cyclone Enawo killed at least 78 people on Madagascar’s vanilla-producing northeastern coast. – Reuters
