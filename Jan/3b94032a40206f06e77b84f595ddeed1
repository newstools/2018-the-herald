Dee Nosh Arts Reporter Inakis Meat Lounge will be a hive of activity this weekend during the Kings Ball party set for tomorrow, featuring various DJs and musicians. All eyes are likely to be on popular wheel spinner Dee Nosh who will be celebrating his birthday during the event. He will be supported by other DJs that include Rax the DJ, Juice the Strongest, Stansplash and Simmz while Smylie and Jah Signal will also provide entertainment. Dee Nosh said he was looking forward to the day when he will be celebrating his 36th birthday. Born Kudzaishe Matongo, Dee Nosh has made it a tradition to throw big parties for his birthday. “I thank the Lord for another year of life. It is a weekend for me as we celebrate together and thank God for taking me this far. I invite people to come in numbers and be with me and other entertainers,” he said. The wheel spinner said he will also use the event to celebrate the life of his father who passed away recently. “I would have loved to celebrate the day with my father, but God had other plans. He has been promoted to the other world and I will always salute him for what he has done in my life. “I will dedicate the day to him as I celebrate his life and achievements. It will be a double celebration for me.” An official at Inakis said they are ready for the special event. “All is set for the day and we have put in place a special programme for the day. We will have various entertainers on the day and we know it will be a memorable occasion,” he said.
