LONDON. — Eden Hazard has confirmed he will commit his future to Chelsea and sign a new contract. The Belgian attended NBA London on Thursday night – where the Boston Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 114-103—alongside Manchester City stars Kevin De Bruyne and Benjamin Mendy. The 27-year-old has recently been linked with a move to Real Madrid, but confirmed he will soon put pen to paper—but not before team-mate Thibaut Courtois also extends. “Yes,” Hazard told Mirror Football when asked whether he will sign a new deal with the champions. “I think Thibaut first. Then I will sign.” Hazard has two years remaining on his contract, while Courtois has just one. Hazard is entering his prime and has scored nine and assisted eight this season. It is just one goal in nine games though for Hazard, with Antonio Conte hopeful of his No.10 rediscovering his scoring touch in today’s clash with Leicester. — The Mirror.
