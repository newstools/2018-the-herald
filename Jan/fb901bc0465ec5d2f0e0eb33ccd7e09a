Martha Leboho Masvingo Correspondent Four family members from Rujeko, Masvingo, have been arraigned before the courts for growing two dagga plants. The four — Ladnos Musvovi (49), Qetywayo Dadirari (40), Johanne Dube (22) and Matthew Dube (21) — all reside at House No. 3788 Mukonde Close, Rujeko A in Masvingo. The four appeared before magistrate Mr Takawira Mugabe facing charges of unlawful possession of dangerous drugs as defined in Section 157 (1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23 last week. In their plea, Musvovi and Dadirai said they did not stay at the residence since they left the house to their children — Johanne and Matthew. They further argued that they only came to the house when water had been disconnected to settle outstanding bills. The duo further argued that they were not aware of any mbanje plant in the garden. Matthew pleaded not guilty claiming that the plants belonged to his brother, Johanne, who pleaded guilty and confirmed owning them. Johanne was remanded in custody to 10 January for trial. Prosecutor Mr Edmond Mapope said on December 28 last year, police went to the house following a tip-off that the family was cultivating mbanje in their garden. A search discovered the two plants of mbanje measuring 187 centimetres and 95cm.
