Roger Federer MELBOURNE. – Roger Federer says he has nothing to improve in his stellar game as he closes in on a 20th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open tennis tournament. The Swiss great had an unimpeded march into tomorrow’s final against Marin Cilic with an abrupt-ending semi-final against South Korean young gun Chung Hyeon yesterday. The defending champion was leading 6-1, 5-2 when Chung called it quits with foot blisters after being treated in a medical timeout for the problem just two games earlier. Federer hasn’t dropped a set in his six matches and is zeroing in on his seventh Australian title in his 30th Grand Slam final. “I just have to play a good match. At this point it’s not about having to improve anything in particular,” he told reporters. – AFP.
