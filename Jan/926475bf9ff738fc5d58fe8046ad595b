President Mnangagwa Fortunate Gora Correspondent The Zimbabwe Liberation and War Collaborators Association (ZILIWACO) in Mashonaland West Province has pledged its full support for President Mnangagwa ahead of harmonised elections set for this year. The Mashonaland West chapter of the organisation held its first provincial council meeting on Friday last week. The ZILIWACO members dispelled the misconception that former President Cde Robert Mugabe was expelled from the revolutionary party. They said Cde Mugabe remained a zanu-pf card-carrying member. Addressing the meeting, ZILIWACO national organising secretary Cde Shine Chakanyuka said all members of the organisation should register as voters. He said there was also need for educating people on the biometric voter registration programme. “We have a number of elderly people who are resisting to register as voters, saying they started voting in 1980 and are not seeing the importance of biometric registration,” he said. “Go and educate them that we now have a new voter’s roll which demands biometric registration.” Cde Chakanyuka urged ZILIWACO members to convince erstwhile G40 runners to join ranks with others and vote for zanu-pf in the elections. “I am sure we are all aware that some of the G40 cabal leaders were expelled from the party, but do not forget that their siblings are still with us,” he said. “We are not going to expel them. They are still party members, but they should not be elected in party structures since they were once lost. “The truth is that the zanu-pf that was led by Cde Mugabe since 1980 is still the same that President Mnangagwa is leading today. So, they should vote for zanu-pf in all the constituencies as well for our President.” He added: “Let me make it clear today that our former President Mugabe was not expelled from the party, we still love him. “He was only asked to rest because of his age, so please go and educate people that they should never shout ‘Pasi naVaMugabe’.”
