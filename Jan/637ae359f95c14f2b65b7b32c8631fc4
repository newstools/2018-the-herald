MELBOURNE. — Roger Federer powered home to beat Marin Cilic in five sets to win his sixth Australian Open tennis crown and 20th Grand Slam title in a riveting final yesterday. The Swiss defending champion dropped his only sets of the tournament before completing a 6-2, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 win over the sixth seeded Croatian in 3 hours and 3 minutes. Federer, playing in his 30th Grand Slam final, joined Novak Djokovic and Australian great Roy Emerson as joint top for the most Australian Open men’s titles. He added to his already imposing win-loss record in Melbourne and is now 94-13. His overall his Grand Slam mark stands at 332-52. The roof was closed over Rod Laver Arena as the tournament’s heat policy was implemented amid evening temperatures of 38 degrees Celsius.Cilic’s serve came under immediate pressure with a whipping backhand return winner for break point which the Croatian followed with a smash into the net for a break in the opening game. The Croat was finding it difficult to settle and changed racquets in his second service game, but it had no obvious benefit as he dropped serve again after three break points to trail 0-3. — AFP.
