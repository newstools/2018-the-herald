Sikhumbuzo Moyo Senior Sports Reporter BARRED Highlanders aspiring chairman Ernest “Maphepha” Sibanda’s camp strongly believes the club’s constitution was trampled on by some ill-advised board members out to settle personal scores against him. Maphepha was barred by the Bosso board of directors from contesting in the February 4 elective annual meeting because the board were not happy he had offered his services to another football club. He was employed as Bantu Rovers’ chief of protocol when they were still in Division One in 2015 and the team was in direct competition with Highlanders’ development side Bosso 90. However, Victoria Falls-based Samuel Sibanda, who will contest the committee member’s position against incumbent Wisdom Mabhena, Peacot Hadebe and Charles Moyo, also offered his services to another club virtually during the same period. Samuel was chairman of Amagagasi in the ZIFA Southern Region Division One league until last year and the club also directly competed against Bosso 90. He, however, seems to have escaped the same scrutiny. Maphepha’s camp feels the board literally usurped powers of the club’s Nomination Court, which is solely empowered to disqualify a candidate from running for office in terms of Article 10.5 to 10.8. Article 10.5 reads: “For purposes of any executive committee election, there is hereby established a Nomination Court, which shall be in charge of the entire election process”. Article 10.7 adds: “The Nomination Court is empowered to receive nominations of candidates, to vet them, approve or disqualify a candidate and in doing so it shall be guided by the provisions of Article Nine of this Constitution.”
