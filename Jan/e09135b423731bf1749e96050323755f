Mathias Mhere Arts Correspondent With a sizzling DVD that he launched last week, gospel sensation Mathias Mhere has set his sights on a successful 2018 with the release of yet another album titled “Panogara Nyasha”. The pint-sized singer is currently in the studio working on the nine track album that would be released “soon”. “I am currently in the studio working on the album. I have finished most of the songs. “I am waiting for some international artistes from Tanzania, Malawi and South Africa whom I roped in to put the vocals on some of the songs,” he said. The musician who has seen his profile growing on the music scene in the past five years said he looks forward to staging international shows with Canada and Australia gigs already confirmed. “I want to thank the Lord that my music is being received in foreign lands. “I also plan to have continental shows to satiate the thirst of regional fans that have stood by me over the years,” he said. The musician who has introduced a one-stop shop for his music has since set up a marketing and distribution company together with a studio to help upcoming artistes. “We helped and recorded many gospel artistes over the years. “It is my hope to make this recording stable a big entity where many artistes can freely come and do their projects without any hindrances,” he said. Though he is riding high on the crest of success, his musical tale has not always been sweet. Since launching his latest album “Old Testament” Mhere has been on a roller coaster and songs proving to be popular include “Dhindindi Full Time”, “Error”, “Nyasha Ndini”, “Munyaradzi”, and “Ndikoko”. Mhere first recorded an album titled “Tinoda Nyasha” in 2008 but failed to make an impact on the local market. He found his glory in 2012 with album “Anoita Minana” followed by “Nguva Yenyasha” that was released in 2013.
