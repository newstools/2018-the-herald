SINGAPORE. — Sergio Garcia produced a masterful display of bogey-free golf over 27 holes yesterday to open his season with a five-shot victory at the weather-disrupted Singapore Open, the Spaniard making his move early and dominating from the front. The 38-year-old US Masters champion signed for a final-round three-under 68 in glorious sunshine to finish on 14-under 270, well clear of Japan’s Satoshi Kodaira and South Africa’s Shaun Norris, who tied for second on nine-under-par. “I played nicely but it wasn’t easy. There were some very challenging holes but I played very well and then was just steady on the back-nine to make sure I wasn’t making any bogeys,” Garcia said in an interview at the trophy ceremony. “It was a great week overall. You still need to hit a lot of good shots to do well here and I was able to do that.” — Reuters
