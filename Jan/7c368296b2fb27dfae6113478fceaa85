Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter CHAMPIONS Harare City Hornets showed there is still life after the departure of star power forward Tatenda Maturure when they outclassed Cheetahs to consolidate their position on the apex of the Harare Basketball Association A League log standings at the weekend. City Hornets, however, did not find it easy as they had to summon their experience to post a 78-61 victory, which left coach Langton Moyo still satisfied against a Cheetahs outfit that is also fighting for honours. “I am very happy for my team. They are playing to instruction and as we go on I just hope that they keep the momentum so that we defend our title. We would have failed if we cannot win the title. I think my charges are doing very well in every aspect of the game. So going forward I see a lot of positives which will surely bring the trophy. “The break gave us ample time to fine tune especially in areas where we were not doing well in the first half of the season. The second stanza is quite promising, I see our team going all the way,” Moyo said. The hard to please former Zimbabwe international has set himself a high target in which he wants his champions to successfully defend their title and proceed to the national championships as the best team in the province. Hornets’ female counterparts also kept top place after picking up maximum points against Bindura University while Green Stars were 44-15 winners over Cousins Academy.
