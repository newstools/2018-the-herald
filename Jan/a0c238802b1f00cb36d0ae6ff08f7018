LONDON. — Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp believes West Bromwich Albion deserved their shock 3-2 win over Liverpool in a FA Cup fourth-round win at Anfield overshadowed by the Video Assistant Referee. Michy Batshuayi scored twice as Chelsea beat Premier League rivals Newcastle 3-0 to advance into the fifth round of the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge yesterday. Batshuayi’s goals in the 31st and 44th minutes and a Marcos Alonso free-kick 18 minutes from time were enough for Premier League champions Chelsea to see off Rafael Benitez’s struggling side. The Belgian’s striker’s first was the result of a neat team move, Pedro’s superb through ball splitting the Newcastle defence and leading to Eden Hazard slipping a pass inside to Alonso. Manchester City ousted Cardiff 2-0 yesterday. “West Brom deserved it, they scored three goals, us only two, and we have to blame ourselves,” the German coach said.
