MANCHESTER. — Pep Guardiola can seem to concentrate more on the aesthetics than the statistics. While he has assessed formidable figures in his managerial career, they appear a by-product of excellence but, after disposing of Newcastle, a footballing philosopher turned his attention to maths. “We need mathematically 10 victories to be champions,” the Manchester City manager said, raising the question of the equation for the first time. Ten victories will take City to 95 points, equalling Chelsea’s English Premier League soccer record. It is the highest total Manchester United can reach and City’s goal difference is 19 better. This, even if Guardiola did not use the phrase, is his countdown to glory. His side’s lead, which had stretched to 15 points, was trimmed to nine for a couple of hours. Victory, and an immediate riposte to defeat by Liverpool at Anfield, has restored it to 12. The visitors’ identity had a pertinence after Guardiola was given a crash course in title-race history. “I read Newcastle dropped a 12-point advantage years ago and United won the league,” he said, aware that perceptions City are uncatchable would have changed with another slip-up. — AFP.
