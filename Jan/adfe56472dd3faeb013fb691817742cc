Muridzo also downplayed the issue saying he just hinted that there are some investments he wanted to pursue. “I did not say I am going to quit. If I quit you will be the first person to know. I just have some investments that I want to focus on,” he said. Mushapaidze was not picking up calls yesterday. Military Touch Movement is a move that was formed to push Zimbabwean music on the continent. It had musicians Jah Prayzah, Andy Muridzo, EQ X and Tahle Wedzinza among others. According to insiders the two’s relationship went sour when Jah Prayzah decided to have collaborations with Mozambican musicians Mr Bao and Tanzanian musician Harmonised. Initially, according to insiders, Muridzo was made to believe that under Military Touch Movement he would have collaborations with these musicians but his master went on to grab the opportunities, leaving Muridzo out of the deals. “The relationship should have collapsed last year but a local businessman saved the situation when he intervened. This time things have gone bad and Andy is not happy with the MTM deal. He is moving out,” said the source.
