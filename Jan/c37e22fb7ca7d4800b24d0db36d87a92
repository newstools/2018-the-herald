Audrey Rundofa Herald Reporter China’S Ambassador to Zimbabwe Huang Ping yesterday signed an affirmation document for a musical project called “Lovely Zimbabwe” developed by local artistes with the help of foreign nationals resident in Zimbabwe. The affirmation document, which was also signed by seven other ambassadors serving in the country, effectively endorses the project, which is designed to canvass international investors to do business with Zimbabwe. Ambassador Ping said Zimbabwe, which is presently in a new era, is working very hard to build a wonderful future. “There is need to increase the mutual understanding of the people and through this song, (a) solid foundation can be created if you put it on website so that more Chinese will access information, as well as investors,” he said. Mr Abraham Matuka, one the artistes behind the project, said the initiative is envisaged to help President Mnangagwa in his endeavour to grow the economy. “This project is called ‘Lovely Zimbabwe’. “We are there to support the President of Zimbabwe in trying to paint a picture to the world that Zimbabwe is a good country where you can come and invest.”
