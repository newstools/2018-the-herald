Yeukai Karengezeka-Chisepo Arts Correspondent Local star-studded movie, “Cook Off” will make its way to the upcoming international Rotterdam Festival to be held in Netherlands from January 28 to 29. The movie premiered barely a month ago. It is a romantic and thrilling 110-minute feature film that was written and directed by Thomas Brickhill and produced by Joe Njagu. It features South Africa-based Zimbabwean actress Tendaiishe Chitima as the main protagonist, Tehn Diamond, Jessesi Mungoshi, Chirikure Chirikure, Anne Nhira, Kudzai Sevenzo, Michael Kudakwashe and others as part of the cast. In an interview, Brickhill said he was on cloud nine and looks forward to strike more deals. “I am very excited about the success of our production and to be part of one of the biggest festivals in the world. It is likely going to open more opportunities to other festivals. “At the same time there is also a film market where distributors come to look for new films so there is a chance that we might be picked for international distribution which would be a major boost for us,” he said. Currently the movie is on a local tour before leaving for Netherlands. “Since the beginning of the year we have been touring different places in the capital with the movie and response has been outstanding. Cinemas are scarce so it is better to bring the movie near film enthusiasts. “We will have a couple of more screenings in Harare before going to the festival and when we come back we plan to do a Bulawayo premiere,” Brickhill said. The filmmakers have are also in talks for a United Kingdom premiere later on this year and will announce date of DVD release in February. The romantic film is based on a young girl named Anesu who loves cooking and her passion leads her to success.
