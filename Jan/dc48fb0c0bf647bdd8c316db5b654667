RIO DE JANEIRO. — Footballing legend Pele said on Monday that Brazil are favourites to win the World Cup in Russia, four years on from their humiliation on home soil. Pele looked frail as he used a zimmer frame to take to the stage at the opening ceremony of the 2019 Carioca Football Championship in Rio on Monday night. The 77-year-old has been limiting his public appearances after a number of health problems last year — which saw him turn up to the 2018 World Cup draw in a wheelchair. But he was on his feet again for the bash in his native country – and as ever had something to say on the state of the world game. Five-time winners Brazil were thrashed 7-1 in the 2014 semi-finals by eventual champions Germany at the Maracana, but Pele, considered one of the best players of all time, insisted that new coach Tite has formed a team ready to put his country’s painful memories to rest. “Those who are Brazilian and believe in Brazil always point to Brazil as the favourites,” the 77-year-old said while attending the opening ceremony of the Rio de Janeiro league. The Selecao romped to qualification as winners of the South American group, with Tite building an exciting side featuring the world’s most expensive player Neymar and new Barcelona signing Philippe Coutinho. — AFP.
