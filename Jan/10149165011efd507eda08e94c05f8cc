Tanya Muzinda Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter MILESTONE-CHASING Zimbabwe’s motocross rider Tanya Muzinda has this year decided to dump all local races as she aims to expand her horizons internationally. The country’s racing “golden girl” has since intensified preparations ahead of her busy overseas schedule, which will take her to the United States, Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom between March and November this year. Muzinda, who charmed the world last year after finishing third in the British Girls Championships in Oxford, England, last year, will head to the United States for the Daytona Championships pencilled for Texas, where she will compete with some of the best racers in the world between March 11 and 12. Seven days later, but still in the United States, the 13-year-old schoolgirl will contest in yet another gruelling meet in the Freestone Motocross competition, where all eyes will be on her exactly three days after her 30-minute documentary is broadcast on BBC Worldwide. Muzinda will then go to Coventry Junior Motocross Club in Coventry, England, where she is scheduled to undergo a medical before she officially joins the club. Thereafter, she will participate in the Girls National Championships series in England, where a lot of prizes will be on offer. Her father Tawanda expressed satisfaction with the manner his daughter’s progress has unfolded. “I am very much happy with Tanya’s preparations ahead of this busy year in terms of her career. She has already intensified preparations and is trying to adjust to the 85cc big wheel she will be riding this year.”
