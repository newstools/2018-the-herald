LONDON. — Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino believes the English Premier League single-season scoring record of 34 goals is under threat from Harry Kane after the striker grabbed two more in a 4-0 victory over Everton at Wembley. Kane made it 10 goals in his last six games in all competitions to become Tottenham’s record scorer in the English Premier League and, after Saturday’s match, the England forward’s top-flight tally for the season stands at 20 with 15 league games still to play. “Harry is fantastic and I congratulate him one more time,” said Pochettino after Kane equalled and then surpassed Teddy Sheringham’s previous record of 97 Premier League goals for the north London club. “He can do anything because of his mentality and how professional he is. “He can achieve all that he wants because of his willingness to work. He’s always thinking and trying to improve, improve, improve and score goals.” — AFP
