Riyad Mahrez LEICESTER. - Riyad Mahrez ended an 10-day standoff with Leicester City yesterday when he was pictured returning to the English Premiership soccer club’s training ground. The Algerian was pictured arriving in a black people carrier at the club’s training ground yesterday morning, less than 24 hours after manager Claude Puel appealed to him to “get his head right” and return. Puel indicated Mahrez would not be available for today’s game against Manchester City, but British media reported yesterday that Mahrez was now keen to play against the team who tried to buy him on transfer deadline day. Mahrez has neither trained nor played with the Leicester team since transfer deadline day when Leicester rejected a bid from the Premier League leaders. British media reported friends of the player saying he has been “depressed” since the deal failed to go through. It was unclear if he has had permission to be away. - Reuters.
