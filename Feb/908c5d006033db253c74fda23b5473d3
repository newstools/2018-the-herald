Innocent Ruwende Senior Reporter Pakistan is keen to boost existing bilateral relations with Zimbabwe by striking new deals in various economic sectors especially agriculture, the country’s Ambassador to Zimbabwe Riaz Bukhari has said. In an interview after addressing members of the National Defence Course 6th Intake-NDC06-2017 at the National Defence University yesterday, Ambassador Bukhari said a joint meeting between the two countries was set for June this year. “Today I am at the prestigious Zimbabwe National Defence University, which is a very friendly institution and we had a good session. Pakistan and Zimbabwe are two friendly countries,” he said. “Our relationship dates back to the pre-Independence era where we helped the people of Zimbabwe to attain their independence. Since then we have been close. We are also helping each other economically. We have a joint economic commission to oversee our economic relationship, our cooperation in the science and agriculture sectors,” he said. Agriculture accounts for about 21 percent of Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product while employing 43 percent of its labour force. Wheat and cotton are the major crops grown and the country is famed for being the world’s 4th largest producer of mangoes. He said the two countries have an ongoing coalition in international fora where they help each other at all levels. Ambassador Bukhari said Pakistan was ready to assist Zimbabwe whenever it had difficulties.
