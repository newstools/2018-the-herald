Hamilton Masakadza SHARJAH. - Continuing their dominance over Zimbabwe, Afghanistan piled up their second-highest ODI total of 333/5 with Rahmat Shah’s 114 off 110 balls the centerpiece of a resounding victory here yesterday. The 24-year old batsman had come in with a sturdy foundation in place but as the score slipped from 90 for 1 to 109 for 3, he felt the need to preserve his wicket and bat long. Rahmat was 37 from 53 balls at the end of the 30th over but picked up the pace towards the end, smashing half of his 12 boundaries in the last 10 overs. He was still no match for a red-hot Najibullah Zadran, who launched five sixes and five fours in an innings of 81 at a strike-rate of 158.82. Only the spinners Graeme Cremer (3-47) and Sikandar Raza (2-58) managed to escape the carnage. Zimbabwe’s chase began brightly enough but they lurched from 50 for 0 to 135 for 8, Rashid Khan once again the wrecker-in-chief, taking four wickets in 5.4 overs. Mujeeb Ur Rahman, the 16-year-old-off-spinner playing his third ODI, opened the bowling for Afghanistan and picked up two wickets. Even Rahmat chipped in, dismissing Kyle Jarvis to hasten their 154-run victory and walked away with the Man-of-the-Match award. - Cricinfo
