Zvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter Complaints relating to the probity and conduct of traditional chiefs should be directed to their Integrity and Ethics Committee in terms of the Constitution, and not to their parent Ministry, Speaker of the National Assembly Advocate Jacob Mudenda has told legislators. Adv Mudenda said despite Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister July Moyo being the responsible administrative authority, he could not deal with disciplinary issues against traditional leaders as it would be in violation of the Constitution. He said this in the National Assembly on Wednesday during the question and answer session. This followed a heated argument between Mutasa Central MP Mr Trevor Saruwaka (MDC-T) and Minister Moyo after the minister declined to respond to a question posed to him regarding the conduct of traditional leaders. Mr Saruwaka had asked what Minister Moyo was doing to reign in traditional leaders who dabble in partisan politics. The back-bencher said Minister Moyo should take decisive action on traditional leaders for openly supporting the ruling party at a “Zanu-PF venue” when they were taking delivery of vehicles during a function officiated by President Emmerson Mnangagwa recently.
